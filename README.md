# Brews: An Introduction

Brews is my final project for the iOS Developer Nanodegree Plus Program. This iOS application uses the BreweryDB API to return information about individual beers that users have added to the REST API. Users must authenticate through their Google or Facebook Login credentials which are stored in Firebase. Each user is able to store beers that sound interesting to them. The user can then access his or her data from any iOS powered device.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install CocoaPods if you don't already have it. 

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Installing


Go ahead and clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/miked9229/Brews.git
```

Open the project in your terminal

```
cd Brews
```

Open the workspace file
```
open Brews.xcworkspace
```

You should then be able to click the play button to run the application in the iOS Simulator
